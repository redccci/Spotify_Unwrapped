# 🎵 Spotify "Unwrapped"

A fun and insightful Python project that analyzes and visualizes the **top universal Spotify songs** using a pre-collected dataset. Inspired by Spotify Wrapped, this version gives you a statistical and visual "unwrapping" of popular global tracks.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
Spotify_Unwrapped/
├── assets/                   # Contains images, plots, or other media files used in the project
├── unwrapped.py             # Main Python script for data analysis and visualization
├── universal_top_spotify_songs.rar  # Compressed dataset of top global Spotify tracks
└── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redccci/Spotify_Unwrapped.git
cd Spotify_Unwrapped
```

### 2. Extract the Dataset

Make sure to extract universal_top_spotify_songs.rar into the project folder. You can use WinRAR, 7-Zip, or any archive tool of your choice. Ensure that the extracted CSV file is in the same directory as the .py file.

### 3. Install Required Libraries

This project uses several Python libraries. Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

Other libraries may be required depending on how `unwrapped.py` is written (e.g., `numpy`, `plotly`, etc.).

### 4. Run the Project

Execute the script:

```bash
python unwrapped.py
```

This will analyze the dataset and generate visualizations related to song popularity, artist frequency, genre distribution, and more.

## 📊 Features

- Parses and analyzes a dataset of Spotify’s most popular songs
- Generates visual summaries using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Designed with an easy-to-follow script and clear visual output
